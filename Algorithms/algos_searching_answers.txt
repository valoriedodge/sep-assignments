Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
fib(10)=55
fib(11)=89
fib(12)=144

Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
With an unsorted collection you would have to use a linear search. And I would most likely use an iterative search because recursive solutions seem to be more costly.

Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
With a sorted collection I would definitely use binary search because it is much faster. I would also use an iterative search if possible, because recursive solutions seem to be more costly.
