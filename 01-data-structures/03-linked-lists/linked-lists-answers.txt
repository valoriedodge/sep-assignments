What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

Spacial Locality is having all of your data altogether so the processor can collect a range of data all at once to reduce the number of times it must read from RAM. This improves performance because reading from RAM takes much longer than reading from Cache.

Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.
Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items to a Linked List.
Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
In the Array, the 5001st item becomes the 5000th, and so on.

I included a screenshot of these benchmark tests. The array was significantly faster than the linked list in all of the tests.
